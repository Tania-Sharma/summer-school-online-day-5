## 🏗 How It Works

1. On clicking *Get Weather*, the extension calls a public IP geolocation API (like ipapi.co) to detect your latitude and longitude.
2. The extension fetches real-time weather data from the [OpenWeatherMap API](https://openweathermap.org/api).
3. The popup displays:
   - temperature
   - weather icon
   - location
   - humidity
   - wind speed
4. You can switch between Celsius and Fahrenheit.
